{
	// Create a local quaternion to store the interpolated quaternion
	CQuaternion qInterpolated;

	// This function is the milk and honey of our quaternion code, the rest of
	// the functions are an appendage to what is done here.  Everyone understands
	// the terms, "matrix to quaternion", "quaternion to matrix", "create quaternion matrix",
	// "quaternion multiplication", etc.. but "SLERP" is the stumbling block, even a little 
	// bit after hearing what it stands for, "Spherical Linear Interpolation".  What that
	// means is that we have 2 quaternions (or rotations) and we want to interpolate between 
	// them.  The reason what it's called "spherical" is that quaternions deal with a sphere.  
	// Linear interpolation just deals with 2 points primarily, where when dealing with angles
	// and rotations, we need to use sin() and cos() for interpolation.  If we wanted to use
	// quaternions for camera rotations, which have much more instant and jerky changes in
	// rotations, we would use Spherical-Cubic Interpolation.  The equation for SLERP is this:
	//
	// q = (((b.a)^-1)^t)a
	//
	// Go here for an a detailed explanation and proofs of this equation:
	//
	// http://www.magic-software.com/Documentation/quat.pdf
	//
	// Now, Let's code it

	// Here we do a check to make sure the 2 quaternions aren't the same, return q1 if they are
	if(q1.x == q2.x && q1.y == q2.y && q1.z == q2.z && q1.w == q2.w) 
		return q1;

	// Following the (b.a) part of the equation, we do a dot product between q1 and q2.
	// We can do a dot product because the same math applied for a 3D vector as a 4D vector.
	float result = (q1.x * q2.x) + (q1.y * q2.y) + (q1.z * q2.z) + (q1.w * q2.w);

	// If the dot product is less than 0, the angle is greater than 90 degrees
	if(result < 0.0f)
	{
		// Negate the second quaternion and the result of the dot product
		q2 = CQuaternion(-q2.x, -q2.y, -q2.z, -q2.w);
		result = -result;
	}

	// Set the first and second scale for the interpolation
	float scale0 = 1 - t, scale1 = t;

	// Next, we want to actually calculate the spherical interpolation.  Since this
	// calculation is quite computationally expensive, we want to only perform it
	// if the angle between the 2 quaternions is large enough to warrant it.  If the
	// angle is fairly small, we can actually just do a simpler linear interpolation
	// of the 2 quaternions, and skip all the complex math.  We create a "delta" value
	// of 0.1 to say that if the cosine of the angle (result of the dot product) between
	// the 2 quaternions is smaller than 0.1, then we do NOT want to perform the full on
	// interpolation using.  This is because you won't really notice the difference.

	// Check if the angle between the 2 quaternions was big enough to warrant such calculations
	if(1 - result > 0.1f)
	{
		// Get the angle between the 2 quaternions, and then store the sin() of that angle
		float theta = (float)acos(result);
		float sinTheta = (float)sin(theta);

		// Calculate the scale for q1 and q2, according to the angle and it's sine value
		scale0 = (float)sin( ( 1 - t ) * theta) / sinTheta;
		scale1 = (float)sin( ( t * theta) ) / sinTheta;
	}	

	// Calculate the x, y, z and w values for the quaternion by using a special
	// form of linear interpolation for quaternions.
	qInterpolated.x = (scale0 * q1.x) + (scale1 * q2.x);
	qInterpolated.y = (scale0 * q1.y) + (scale1 * q2.y);
	qInterpolated.z = (scale0 * q1.z) + (scale1 * q2.z);
